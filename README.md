#### Framework for creating data model-driven GraphQL API services

As a developer you can focus on defining your application's data model, and Warpgrapher takes care of generating a graph-based API for interacting with that model. In addition to generating CRUD APIs for interacting with the model, Warpgrapher provides a set of advanced features to customize and extend your service. 

Supported Databases:

* CosmosDB
* Gremlin-based Databases (e.g. Apache Tinkerpop and AWS Neptune)
* Neo4j
