# Relationship CRUD Operations

Warpgrapher automatically creates a set of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each relationships within each `Type` defined in the config. This page describes the format of those automatically generated GraphQL operations. For for more details on general GraphQL syntax, see: [https://graphql.org/learn/](https://graphql.org/learn/).

query {
    ProjectIssues(input: {
        src: {
            Project: {
                name: "Project 0"
            }
        }
    })

}
```

#### Find relationships by dst node

```
query {
    ProjectIssues(input: {
        dst: {
            Feature: {

# `Rel Create`

#### Create relationship between pair of existing nodes

```
mutation {
    ProjectOwnerCreate(input: {
        $MATCH: {
            name: "Project0"
        },
        $CREATE: {
            dst: {
                User: {
                    $EXISTING: {
                        name: "Jane"

                }
            }
        } 
    })
    {...}
}
```


#### Create relationship between from existing node to new node

```
mutation {
    ProjectOwnerCreate(input: {
        $MATCH: {
            name: "Project0"
        },
        $CREATE: {
            dst: {
                User: {
                    $NEW: {

        } 
    })
    {...}
}
```

# `Rel Update`

#### Update relationships props

```
mutation {
    ProjectOwnerUpdate(input: {
        $MATCH: {
            props: {
                sin
            }
        }
    })
    {
        id
    }
}
```


# `Rel Delete`

#### Delete relationships

```
mutation {
    ProjectOwnerDelete(input: {
        $MATCH: {
            src: {
                Project: {
                    name: "Project0"
