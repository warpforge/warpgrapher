# Warpgrapher CRUD API

Version: `0.10.4`

One of the primary features of Warpgrapher is the auto-generation of CRUD operations for all Types. This includes basic and advanced queries that support nested operations and graph traversals. The schema itself was described in the preceeding sections. This chapter provides a set of usage examples for the various queries and mutations, for both nodes and relationships.
