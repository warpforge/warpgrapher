# Introduction

Warpgrapher is published as a Rust crate. There are crate features for each of the databases supported as a back-end. For Gremlin-based databases such as Apache Tinkerpop, AWS Neptune, and Azure CosmosDB, use the `gremlin` feature.

```toml
[dependencies]
warpgrapher = { version = "0.9.0", features = ["gremlin"] }
```

For Neo4j, use the Neo4j feature.

```toml
[dependencies]
warpgrapher = { version = "0.9.0", features = ["neo4j"] }
```

The database features are not mutually exclusive, so building with both features enabled will not do any harm. However, only one database may be used for an instance of the Warpgrapher engine. Compiling with no database features selected will succeed, but the resulting engine will have sharply limited functionality, as it will have no ability to connect to a back-end storage mechanism.
