//! Warpgrapher makes it painless to create web services with graph-based data
//! models. Describe the data model for which you want to run a web service.
//! Wargrapher automatically generates a GraphQL schema from the data model, as
//! well as a set of resolvers for basic create, read, update, and delete (CRUD)
//! operations on that data. If you need more more sophisticated endpoints, you
//! can supply your own custom resolvers. Warpgrapher will automatically
//! generate the GraphQL configuration and invoke your custom resolvers when
//! appropriate.
